   <script src="index.js">/*Hey y'all! It's the last day of the cruise and i just wanted to say y'all were amazing! This was my 7th cruise, but my first celebrity and when I got on board and saw the relatively older crowd than what I'm used to on cruises, I was not expecting to make any friends, but then I met y'all at xclub and I enjoyed every moment of every day after that! I hope we all can stay in touch after the cruise is over. 2 of my best friends rn are people I met on a cruise and I talk to them almost every day even after over a year, so I hope that happens with all of us! Well, I made y'all a christmas card: https://holidays.aarushmagic.com/individuals/2022/reflection.html*/</script></html>
