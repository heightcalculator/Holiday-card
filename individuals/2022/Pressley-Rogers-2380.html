   <p>Hello Pressley!<br>I just wanted to wish you a Merry Christmas and a Happy New Year!! I also wanted to say thank you. I know I've had times of stress and trouble with you and I have had times when I wished I had never met you, but even still, you have stayed one of my best friends and one of the people I care about the most. I'm currently typing this out on the cruise and I really miss you. Wish I could go back and hang out with you. You're actually amazing! I love you! </p>
