   <p>Hello Taylor!<br>First of all, I love you so much!! Thank you for the amazing T-shirt and thank you for being the amazing person who you are. Last semester was absolutely amazing with you and you always helped me cheer myself up. I want to thank you for putting up with all my bullying and kicking you off the bus seats. I know we don't have any class together next semester and it may become hard to talk, but I hope we can continue hanging out outside of school (hopefully more frequently than we have been). I wish you and your family a Merry Christamas and a Happy New Year. I hope we get to see each other soon. I miss you, and I love you!!<br>Hope to see you soon!</p>
