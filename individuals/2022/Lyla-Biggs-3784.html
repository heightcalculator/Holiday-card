   <p>Hello Lyla!<br>I just wanted to say thank you for being amazing! I know we didn't have any classes together and we barely got to see each other (except when I felt like coming to annoy you), but it still felt like you were there for me every day at every moment. And that is something I have never felt from anyone else. I hope you had an amaing semester and I wish you an amazing last semester of highschool. I also wanted to wish you happy holidays (and merry christmas) and a wonderful new year! I hope we can actually hang out some time outside of school. I know you're really busy and it's hard for you, but I really enjoy your company and I hope you enjoy mine just as much. You're such a wonderful person who I look forward to being like and I'm not sure if I will ever be able to truly express that. Congratulations on all your acheivements and your acceptance into all the amazing colleges! Always keep on trying and don't forget about me!<br>Hope to see you soon! I love you sis. I miss you &#10084;</p>
